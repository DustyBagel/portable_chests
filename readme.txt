Notes about the mod:

I know that the portable chest is a bit over powered because of how cheap it is.
I would love some player feedback about how I can address this issue which can be 
added to the issue on github at https://github.com/DustyBagel/portable_chests/issues/1

Acknowledgment:

The default_chest_open texture is from the default mod in minetest_game but is
not included in this mod. I did not create it. That belongs to the creators of
the default mod included in minetest_game. The "default" mod can be found here:
https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/tree/master/mods/default.
